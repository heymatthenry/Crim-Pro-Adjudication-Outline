# Guilty Pleas

## Generally

* Entering a guilty plea means the ∆ is waiving her constitutional trial rights. There is no point in the criminal system in which the defendant makes a more significant decision with greater implications.
* The sentencing stage is distinct from the trial phase and is not obviated by the fact of a guilty plea.
* Nolo contendere (no contest)—latin phrase meaning I will not contest it.  The important thing here is that this plea does not serve as an admission of guilt in a later civil proceeding.  
    * The plea does not have any type of character of a confession or representation.  
    * It is very similar to a guilty plea though.  It is an assent to a judgment of conviction.  It waives all of your constitutional and statutory trial rights.  
    * This plea requires approval by the court and the court has broad discretion to allow or disallow this plea.
* Alford Plea—emerged from an NC case in which defendant wanted to enter a guilty plea while simultaneously maintaining his innocence.  
    * This is different from a NOLO plea but barely.  Both are functional guilty pleas and require judicial approval.  
    * In some state and in the federal system a Nolo plea does not require the court to find a factual basis for the plea.  
* This is the difference with an Alford plea; Alford requires the court to find a factual basis for the plea.  Typically this comes in the form of a proffer by the state which is a showing of what the state would prove if the case went to trial.  The court cannot force the state to make a proffer.
* A conviction on a nolo plea is still a conviction which means that a defendant in a criminal trial could still be used to impeach the defendant under FRE 609.  It can be used for impeachment but not as an admission of guilt.
* Conditional Guilty Plea—there has been a pre-trial motion to suppress crucial evidence and the defendant loses the suppression motion.  They plead guilty on the condition that they can withdraw their plea if the appellate court over turns the suppression motion.

## Voluntariness

* Under the federal rules, the guilty plea is governed by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  There is an analogue in state rules.  These rules arose as a response to the under-regulation of the plea bargaining process.
* *Boykin v. Alabama*—mid-1960s an African American indigent defendant is charged with 5 counts of armed robbery, which was a potential capital offense at the time.  The record shows that the defendant showed up for court, plead guilty to all five counts and the very same day was sentenced to death.
    * This was not a legally deficient proceeding under law at the time.  
    * The Supreme Court holds that a plea of guilty must be voluntary and knowing and the record must contain sufficient facts for an appellate court to ascertain that the plea was voluntary and knowing.  
        * A colloquy must be held in open court that is sufficient to establish the voluntary and knowing nature of the plea.
        * States may place the burden of proving a defective guilty plea on the person challenging the validity of the prior conviction
* Judge must evaluate all of the surrounding circumstances on a case-by-case basis
* If there is any credible evidence that the defendant’s proffered plea was not the product of free will, a more searching inquiry must be undertaken by the trial judge
* If the defendant is judged competent to stand trial he or she is competent to enter a plea

## Knowing and Intelligent

* Rule 11(b) requires the judge to convey all information in the rule and ensure that the defendant understand all of the information communicated by the court
* The defendant must understand all of the charges and the penalties

## Plea Procedures

* Judge must find a factual basis
* Rule 11(b) governs considering and accepting a guilty or nolo contendere plea.  The rule requires that a defendant be informed of all the rights he is waiving by pleading guilty.  The defendant must be informed of the nature of the charges to which he is pleading guilty and all sanctions including mandatory minimums and the possible maximum sentence.
* If the defendant pleads guilty and then wants to withdraw the plea on the basis that he was not fully informed under rule 11, what happens?
    1. Does the harmless error standard apply?
        * For example what if the state could show that the defendant knew of the omitted information through other means.

## Ethical issues in communicating plea information to clients 

* Courts presume that counsel will inform the defendant of necessary information to the degree that except in extreme cases (see e.g. Henderson v. Morgan pg. 386). Presumption that counsel acted properly in informing the defendant overrides a deficiency in the rule 11 requirements when the plea was accepted.
* The law requires that a defendant must know all of the direct consequences of the guilty plea
    * Direct Consequences are the maximum sentence authorized, increases triggered by the operation of other statutes (i.e. sentencing enhancement like using a weapon), (Rule 11(b)(1)(H-M)).
    * Indirect consequences are things like loss of right to vote or own a weapon, inability to get passport, or to get a license to practice law, medicine, etc….
* Also, possible evidentiary use of guilty plea in a future civil or criminal proceeding.
* Is deportation a direct or indirect consequence?
    * (Rule 11(b)(1)(O) requires that defendant is informed of the immigration consequences and this rule is a consequence of the court’s decision in *Padilla v. Kentucky*
* *Padilla v. Kentucky*—a This case determined that it is IAC for a defense attorney not to inform the client about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea.
* Statements made in the course of plea brgaining are  inadmissible against the defendant of the defendant does not actualy plead guilty or pleads guilty but later withdraws the plea
* A defendant who pleads guilty waives the Fifth Amendment with reagard to the plea proeedings
    * The plea does not operate as a waiver of that privilege at sentencing
