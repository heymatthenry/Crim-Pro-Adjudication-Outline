## Constitutional Requirements

* The due process guarantee of the Fifth and 14th amendments gives the criminal accused the right to a fair trial.  Sometimes this is only possible if the accused is accorded some discovery from the prosecution.

### *Brady v. Maryland*

* In *Brady v. Maryland* the court held that the suppression of evidence that is favorable to the accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material to guilt or punishment irrespective of good or bad faith of the prosecutor. 
    * Favorable to the accused is information that every prosecutor would think the defense would want to know about; that evidence which a reasonably skilled prosecutor should know could be fairly and properly used to advantage by the accused

### *US v. Bagley*

* Bagley gets rid of the “upon request” portion of the Brady rule.  Whether the defendant makes a specific or a general request, or no request at all, the obligation is a constitutional obligation related to the fairness of the trial.  If it meets the standards of materiality and is favorable to the accused, it needs to be turned over to the defense.
    * Bagley also gives some definition to the term “material”.  Evidence is “material” if there is a “reasonable probability that had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Reasonable probability means a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome
* A showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance of the evidence that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted in the defendant’s acquittal
* The question is whether the defendant received a fair trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence
    * Bagley is not a sufficiency of the evidence test in that the accused must demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidenc in light of the undisclosed evidence, there was not enough evidence to convict.  Rather, the accused must show that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict
    * Once a reviewing court has found constitutional error, there is no need for further harmless error review; no such error could be deemed harmless since the accused did not in fact receive a fair trial worthy of confidence
    * Materiality is defined in terms of suppressed evidence considered collectively, not item by item

### Kyles v. Whitley

* Kyles v. Whitley emphasizes that the Brady inquiry is not an item specific inquiry.  Courts should not look at each item in isolation to determine materiality; the court should look at the undisclosed evidence collectively.
    * Kyles v. Whitely also stands for the proposition that prosecutors have an affirmative duty to disclose information that has not come into their own awareness (police reports, etc) as long as the information comes from a government entity that is part of the “prosecution team”.
* Brady does not extend to information that is known to the defense or should be known to the defense through reasonable due diligence

## Preservation of Evidence

* *Trombetta* allows for a sixth amendment violation claim for failure to preserve evidence without a showing of good or bad faith if it can be shown that the evidence had exculpatory value.  That is the difference between Trombetta and Youngblood—Youngblood evidence was only potentially exculpatory (no existing evidence that it actually WAS exculpatory)
* Youngblood held that whenever potentially exculpatory evidence is permanently lost because of negligence on the part of the police, the defendant must show bad faith on the part of the police or prosecutor in order for the error to constitute a denial of due process of law.
    * Good or bad faith becomes a proxy for the likely evidentiary value of what was lost.

## Discovery Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure—Rule 16

* The argument is that the defendant is still in control of the access to information because the obligation to disclose does not arise unless the defendant makes a request for information from the prosecution.
* This waiver argument does not apply in regards to the notice of alibi requirement in Rule 12.1
    * In this case though it is not the rule that is compelling the disclosure of the alibi defense, the trial itself compels this.  If he wants to raise an alibi defense it is the trial that will compel him to reveal the alibi information.  The rule therefore only affects the timing of this disclosure.  The rule adds no new compulsion.

### Applicability of the rules to particular types of evidence

#### Defendant Statements in the Prosecution's Possession

* Relevant written or recorded statements of the defendant which the government has in its possession, custody, or control and knows or should know about through due diligence
* The substance of any oral statement by the defendant made to a known government agent during interrogation which the government intends to offer into evidence
* The portion of any written record containing the substance of any relevant oral statement made by the defendant during interrogation to a known government agent
* Recorded statements the defendant made to a GJ relating to the instant offense

#### Tests

* Rule 16 establishes reciprocal discovery for the reports of physical or mental examinations and other scientific tests or experiments 
* Defense receives those reports that are material to trial preparation while the prosecution receives only those that are related to proof at trial 

#### Summary of Expert Witness Testimony

* Rule requires disclosure of
* An intent to rely on expert opinion testimony
* Content and basis of the testimony
* Qualifications of the expert witness

#### Documents and Objects

* Those objects and documents material to preparation of the defense
* Intended to be used as evidence by the government
    * Applies only to case in chief, not other claims like selective prosecution
* Belong to or were obtained from the defendant

#### Prior Criminal Record

* Applies to record of defendant (not witnesses) if it is in the possession, custody, or control or the prosecuting authority

#### Witness List

* Not required to provide a witness list other than experts
    * May be mandated by court rules
    * Different rule applies for capital cases

#### Person’s Physical Characteristics

* Not required by the rule but courts may use their inherent authority to require disclosure of this information

### Information Not Subject to Disclosure

* Work Product
* Defendant statements in the possession of the defendant
* Identity of confidential informants

### Witness Statements—The Jencks Act

* After a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct examination, the court, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, must order an attorney for the government or the defendant and the defendant's attorney to produce, for the examination and use of the moving party, any statement of the witness that is in their possession and that relates to the subject matter of the witness's testimony.
    * 18 U.S.C. §3500—Statute Codifying the Jenks Rule from the Jenks case.  It was later moved to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (26.2), at which point it became a reciprocal obligation. Does not apply to the defendant (would violate the 5A privilege).
