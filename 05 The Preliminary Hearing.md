# The Preliminary Hearing

## Purpose of the hearing and the PC standard

* The purpose of the preliminary hearing is for the government to prove that it has probable cause to believe that (1) that an offense occurred; and (2) that ∆ was responsible
* The PC hearing is only required for felonies—not misdemeanors
    * A felony is any offense for which the potential sentence is more than a year (1-year exactly isn't enough)
* PC std: “there must be evidence sufficient to induce a person of ordinary prudence and caution conscientiously to entertain a reasonable belief that the defendant committed the crime charged.” *Ayala*
    * evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the state.
        - Determining credibility of evidence & witnesses is for the trial
    * *Ayala*: "Presumption and inferences may be drawn only from facts established, and presumption may not rest on presumption or inference on inference … and this rule is doubly applicable in criminal cases."
* In the federal system, PC hearing is cancelled when the gov't gets a grand jury indictment or if ∆ waives the hearing
* The result of a PC hearing may be appealable
    - Harmless error review
    - But most courts determine that any error at the PC stage is cured by ∆'s subsequent conviction

## Functions of the PC hearing in the process

* **Screening mechanism**
    1. Determination of probable cause to proceed with the prosecution
    2. By the time the person gets to a preliminary hearing there has already been probable cause either through an arrest warrant or through a first appearance “Gerstein Hearing”
* **Discovery**
    1. Criminal discovery is extremely limited so this can be an important opportunity for the defendant
        * Listen carefully and possibly cross examine prosecution witnesses
        * Call prosecution witnesses as defense witnesses if prosecution is unlikely to call them in preliminary hearing, though many judges dislike this tactic.
    2. The proof standards at preliminary hearings are lower than those at a full blown trial
        * Hearsay testimony is admissible at a preliminary hearing
            * The prosecution can use this to prevent their key witnesses for trial from testifying at the preliminary hearing
        * The rules of evidence are for the most part suspended during this hearing
* **Preservation of Testimony**
    * Under the FRE when a witness becomes unavailable under the meaning of the rules, prior testimony given by the witness can be offered in evidence if the opposing party had an adequate opportunity for cross examination.
* **Test or Prepare Witness**
    * Counsel for either side can use the preliminary hearing to assess whether a particular witness comes across well or poorly, or is even willing to testify at all
* **Facilitate Later Impeachment**
    * The adverse counsel (usually defense) has the opportunity to elicit contradictory statements, or at least ambiguous or ambivalent shadings to questions on cross examination
* **Solidify Identification**
* **Send Message to Witnesses**
* **Reality Therapy for Defendant**
* **Affect Plea Bargaining**
* **Affect Bail Decision**
* **Diversion Programs**
