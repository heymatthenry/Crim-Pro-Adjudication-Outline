## Generally

* Questions of joinder and severance arise when a person commits more than one crime or when two or more people join together to engage in criminal activity
* Joinder is the process of joining two people or crimes together into one indictment or trial.  Severance is the process of undoing joinder
* Courts seem to have a strong preference for joinder on the grounds of the efficiency of a single trial.
    * *However*, there are also fairness concerns that motivate the rules regarding severance
        * The defendant may become embarrassed or confounded by presenting multiple defenses
        * The jury may use evidence of one crime to infer a criminal disposition on the part of the defendant from which they infer guilt on the other charges
        * The jury may cumulate evidence of the various crimes and find guilt while if considered separately it would not so find
        * There may be a latent feeling of hostility engendered by the charging of several crimes as opposed to one
* Strategic benefits of Severance
    * Evidence admissible for crime X but not for crime Y will still be heard by jury if the crimes are joined.  Seek severance to keep info away from jury 
    * Permit the defendant to testify in one case but keep silent in another
    * Avoid resenting seemingly inconsistent defenses to the jury
    * Severance motion could induce better deal in plea bargaining
    * The motion process for severance may provide an opportunity for discovery

## Rules

### Rule 8—Joinder of Offenses or Defendants

> (a) Joinder of Offenses. The indictment or information may charge a defendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses charged—whether felonies or misdemeanors or both—are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.

* Common Scheme or Plan—whether commission of one offense either depended upon or necessarily led to the commission of the other, proof of one either constituted or depended upon proof of another
* Similar Character—elements of statutory offense, temporal proximity of acts, likelihood and extent of evidentiary overlap, physical location, modus operandi, identity of the victims
    * Similar character should be readily apparent from facts in indictment
* Same Act or Transaction—whether the offenses come from the same sequence of events
 
> (b) Joinder of Defendants. The indictment or information may charge 2 or more defendants if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction, or in the same series of acts or transactions, constituting an offense or offenses. The defendants may be charged in one or more counts together or separately. All defendants need not be charged in each count.

*  The key is that the indictment allege that all defendants participated together in the criminal enterprise

### Rule 13—Joint trial of Separate Cases

> The court may order that separate cases be tried together as though brought in a single indictment or information if all offenses and all defendants could have been joined in a single indictment or information.

### Rule 14—Relief from Prejudicial Joinder

> (a) Relief. If the joinder of offenses or defendants in an indictment, an information, or a consolidation for trial appears to prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts, sever the defendants’ trials, or provide any other relief that justice requires.
(b) Defendant's Statements. Before ruling on a defendant's motion to sever, the court may order an attorney for the government to deliver to the court for in camera inspection any defendant's statement that the government intends to use as evidence. (BRUTON)

### Notes

* Rule 8 is all about the pleadings.  The motion is directed at the information in the pleadings and their relation to the standards set forth in Rule 8A or 8B.  The motion would be a motion for joinder or severance, but this is different from a motion for severance under Rule 14 which depends not on what has been plead, but rather on what has been proven at trial.
* If you move for severance under Rule 8(a) or (b), it will require the
government to say something about why the joinder is proper. The prosecutor usually will respond with likely proof. Essentially, it can be a
good discovery device.
    * a difference between Rule 8 and Rule 14 is that you do not have to renew a Rule 8 joinder motion at the rest of the gov’ts case at trial, but you dohave to renew a Rule 14 motion at the rest of the gov’ts case at trial.
    * Violation of rule 8 only requires reversal if it will prejudice the defendant
* Rule 14 is highly context dependent. However there are a few general principles.
    * The presumption is in favor of joint trials for multiple defendants; courts are thinking heavily about the resource demands of multiple trials for the same criminal conduct.
    * Rule 14 cases tend to place a great amount of faith in the limiting instruction to inoculate the jury from the prejudices that can arise in a joint trial.  This is referred to as “spillover prejudice”.  This is the risk that properly admitted evidence as to one defendant or one count/charge may spillover and be used against a different defendant or a charge for which it is inadmissible.
    * Courts will often look to the jury’s verdict and if the jury returns a non-uniform verdict this is seen as evidence that the jury was able to properly follow the limiting instructions and properly compartmentalize the evidence as instructed    

## The Bruton Doctrine

* When a co-defendant’s confession implicates a criminal defendant, and the co-defendant does not testify at trial, the admission of the confession violates the criminal defendant’s rights under the 6th amendment Confrontation Clause, even when jury instructions are given that instruct the jury to disregard the co-defendant’s confession in deciding the criminal defendant’s guilt.
    * The conspiracy exception to hearsay rules no longer applies because the confession was made after the conspiracy was completed
* Later cases modified Bruton and held that the confrontation clause is not violated by the admission of a non-testifying codefendant’s confession if:
    * a proper limiting instruction is given and
    * the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant’s name but also any reference to his or her existence.
        * To be sufficient any redaction must eliminate the defendant’s name as well as all references to his or her existence
* A redaction that references a vague unnamed accomplice may or may not be deficient, depending on the circumstances
