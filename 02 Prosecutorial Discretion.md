# Prosecutorial Discretion

* Vindictive prosecution videos: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn4xgo4h-SU&list=UUW8X2enjxf9LsaZ_qci90jA), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL37_5fHnJw&list=UUW8X2enjxf9LsaZ_qci90jA "Vindictive Prosecution: The Presumption - YouTube")

## Generally

* Discretion allows prosecutors to:
    * allocate scare resources in accordance with policy priorities
    * individualize the process for a particular ∆
        * Sometimes a case is too trivial, or prosecution isn't in the public interest. Or ∆ has info for law enforcement.

## Standing

* Challenges to prosecutorial discretion are virtually impossible by people other than the person being prosecuted. The Supreme Court has noted that this “Court’s prior decisions consistently hold that a citizen lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he himself is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution.” Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614 (1973)
* *Attica Inmates v. Rockefeller*:
    * The Court found that it would violate separation of powers to direct the DOJ to prosecute
    * Court didn't have access to all of the Grand Jury info
* Compelled prosecution is impermissible, but compulsory arrest is OK (e.g. DV cases)
    * Compulsory arrest is w/in executive discretion—it's not the court compelling it

## Victim discretion

* While the decision to (not) prosecute is up to the prosecutor, the state will consider the victim's wishes, taking into account:
    - Whether the victim was a wrongdoer
    - Previous relationship between ∆ and V
    - V's socioeconomic status

> **Rule 60. Victim's Rights**
> (a) In General.

> (1) *Notice of a Proceeding.* The government must use its best efforts to give the victim reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding involving the crime.

> (2) *Attending the Proceeding.* The court must not exclude a victim from a public court proceeding involving the crime, unless the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the victim's testimony would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding. In determining whether to exclude a victim, the court must make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and must consider reasonable alternatives to exclusion. The reasons for any exclusion must be clearly stated on the record.

> (3) *Right to Be Heard on Release, a Plea, or Sentencing.* The court must permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning release, plea, or sentencing involving the crime.

* Court can enforce these rights via mandamus.

## Police discretion

* Police usually have discretion on whether to arrest a subject **except**:
    - NC: Mandatory arrest for DVPO violation or when ∆ is the initial aggresor in a DV situtation
        + **But**: No private cause of action for failure to perform duty (*Castlerock*)

## Constraints on prosecutorial discretion:

* Rebuttable presumption that prosecutor's decision to bring charges was in good faith
* Office guidelines typically require:
    - Some chance of success at trial (e.g. PC)
    - Alignment of likely sentence w/ community standards & ∆ interests
* There are essentially no enforceable standards on prosecutorial discretion, but informaal constraints such as:
    * Resources
    * Public perception
    * Office culture
    * Relationships with investigative agencies
    * Internal regulations

## Selective Prosecution

* Defendant may challenge decision to prosecute on EP grounds. Must prove:
    1. **Discriminatory effect**: Similarly situated individuals were not prosecuted **AND**
    2. **Discriminatory intent**: Decision to prosecute was based on ∆'s race, religion, political affiliation, or exercise of constitutional rights
* *Yick Wo* — All but one ∆ prosecuted under laundry law was chinese—overwhelming evidence of EP violation
* *Oyler v. Boles* — Selective prosecution claims must be brought in a pretrial motion, otherwise waived
	* If ∆ wins, gov't may appeal (Also true for vindictive prosecution)
* *Wayte v. US* — ∆ didn't show that gov't had prosecuted him *because* of his
  protest activity, so couldn't prove selective prosecution
* *Armstrong* — In order to get discovery for SP claim, ∆ must give some
  evidence that gov't didn't prosecute other, similar individuals.
	* Standard to get discovery is basically the same as burden to win on the
	  merits
    * Purpose of high bar is to discourage frivolous SP claims
* Hence: SP claims are often litigated and seldom won.

## Vindictive Prosecution

* Involves DP
* Vindictive prosecution: prosecution because ∆ exercised some constitutional right, e.g. seeking death because ∆ woudln't plead.
* Because of proof problems and because asking prosecutors to explain their motives would implicate separation of powers, courts will presume a vindictive motive, **BUT ONLY** when there is a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness
* *Goodwin*: ∆ went to trial & the state decided to seek death. *Not* vindictive because there was a new prosecutor who made the decision to seek death who wasn't involved in the prior negotiation
* *Blackledge*: Same facts as *Goodwin*, but vindictive because it was the same prosecutor throughout.
* When vindictiveness isn't *reasonably likely*, ∆ has to show actual vindictiveness
* Prosecution can rebut by showing new circumstances justifying new charging decision
