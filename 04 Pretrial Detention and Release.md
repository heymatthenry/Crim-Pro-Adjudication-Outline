# Pretrial Detention and Release

* [Bail Reform Act video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI1LZOlfOBI&list=UUW8X2enjxf9LsaZ_qci90jA)

## Reasons for pretrial detention

* Ensure ∆'s appearance at trial
* Protect evidence
* Public safety
    - However, citing potential risks to the public is a kind of punishment without an adjudication
        + *Salerno*: If gov't shows by clear & convincing evidence that ∆ poses a public safety risk, ∆ can be detained without offending the DPC
            * Only limit is whether detention is excessive w/r/t perceived harm
    - Big assumption that courts can predict who poses a threat to the community

## Reasons for pretrial release

* Allow ∆ to prepare a defense
* Prevent harm due to incarceration:
    - lost jobs/wages
    - lost time with family
    - psychological harm

## Bail

### Kinds of pretrial release

#### Full cash bond

- ∆ pays full amount of bond in cash
- If ∆ shows up for trial, bond is returned; otherwise ∆ may forfeit entire amount
- Court can require a hearing on the source of ∆'s bond money to determine whether it is legitimate. This is a good discovery opportunity for the state.
- Full cash bond is rarely imposed (~3%)

#### Deposit bond

- ∆ pays a percentage of the total bond as a deposit
- If ∆ fails to appear, full amount becomes due
- Also rare (~6%)

#### Surety bond

- *Bail bonds company*: ∆ pays a percentage of the bond amount to a private company which, in turns, signs a promissory note for the court
- Amount paid to bail bond company is gone regardless of whether ∆ shows up for trial
- If ∆ absconds, the court may forgive the debt obligation or the company may recapture ∆ to receive the money

##### Authority to recapture

* State can try ∆ even when he is brought in through force

##### Policy arguments

- Bail bonds companies are not state actors and so are not subject to many constitutional constraints. Essentially they're doing law enforcement work without having to play by the typical rules under which police operate
- ∆s' freedom shouldn't depend on whether a private company wants to take on the risk of their absconding
- Smaller financial outlay by ∆, less incentive to show
- Saves taxpayer money

#### Unsecured bond

- ∆ pays nothing up front, but full amount becomes due if ∆ misses court
- May come with conditions, e.g. no-contact orders, travel restrictions, maintain employment, etc.
- Preferred option under federal & many state systems

#### Recognizance

- ∆ is released on essentially a promise to come to court
- Court may attach conditions 
- Presumption for this form of release in some jxns.

#### Conditional release

- Court imposes conditions on ∆'s release (travel restrictions, no contact orders, meet with pretrial services, etc.)
- May be used in conjunction with other forms of bail
- Violation of conditions may result in detention or additional charges (e.g. contempt)

#### Property bond

* ∆ puts up collateral for bond amount rather than cash

### The Bail Hearing

* No right to counsel at this stage
* Rules of evidence do not apply

### Bail Reform Act

* Enacted to fix problem of prosecutors seeking pretrial detention as a form of punishment/preventive detention
* *US v. Salerno*
    - SCOTUS upheld constitutionality of Act:
        + Detention is regulatory
        + Process requirement is satisfied by making state show risk of harm by C&C evidence
* Main improvements over old system:
    - Prohibits use of high bond amounts as a form of detention
    - Formally authorizes prosecutors to state future dangerousness as a reason for pretrial detention (rather than doing so in a non-transparent fashion)

#### Bail decisions under the Act

1. Presumption of recognizance—Prosecution must show that recognizance will not adequately ensure ∆'s appearance at trial or protect the community
    - In deciding whether RoR is appropriate, court considers:
        1. Nature of the offense
        2. Weight of the evidence
        3. Characteristics of the Defendant
            - Character, community ties, etc.
            - Under pretrial release at time of offense
        4.  Nature and seriousness of the danger to the community or specific persons
2. If ∆ isn't given RoR, court must impose least restrictive conditions to ensure appearance & public safety
3. If no conditions will work, ∆ may be detained pending a hearing
    * The issue at the hearing is whether release on any condition or combo of conditions will reasonably ensure the appearance of the defendant and/or the safety of the community
        * The rules of evidence do not apply
        * Factual submissions may be made by proffer
        * D has the right to counsel (including appointed counsel), the right to testify and present witnesses, and the right to cross-examine government witnesses
    * The hearing can be triggered in one of two ways: 
        1. on a motion by the prosecutor which alleges the existence of certain statutory “danger” criteria: 
            * Crime of violence
            * Max sentence of life or death
            * Certain drug offenses (10yrs or more)
            * Any felony case if the D has already been convicted of 2 or more offenses described above
        2. **OR** on the prosecution's or the court’s motion alleging a risk of flight or risk of obstruction of justice.  
            * If the government’s theory is flight risk they must prove it by a preponderance of the evidence
            * If the government’s theory is danger to the community it must be proved by clear and convincing evidence 
                * this higher evidentiary burden is meant to implicate the DPC
