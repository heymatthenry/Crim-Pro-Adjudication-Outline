# Introduction

## Cornerstones of the Judicial Process

1. Discovery of Truth
    * "Discovery of the truth also requires an adjudication process that is reliable both in the convicting the guilty defendant and exonerating the defendant who is erroneously accused."
    * "Despite its importance, the truthfinding objective of the criminal justice process is, in certain respects, sacrificed for the benefit of other values"
    * Superseded by ∆-friendly values like 4A and privilege against self-incrimination
    * Or prosecution-friendly scenarios in which evidence favorable to ∆ is kept out due to other witnesses' privilege
    * Also subject to resource constraints
2. Adversary adjudication
    * US system isn't "purely" adversarial—there are limits on what each party may do
        * And the judge may intervene in proceedings
    * "Adversarial adjudication is supported on two grounds: (1) as the system of adjudication most likely to produce accurate verdicts, and (2) as a system that respects individual autonomy and reflects the proper relationship between the individual and the state."
3. Accusatorial Burdens
    * "Requiring the government to make the initial presentation of evidence strengthens the safeguard against wrongful conviction and ensures that the government carries the central burden of the litigation."
    * Subject to limits: burden shifts when ∆ puts on an affirmative defense like self-defense or wants to show he is not competent for trial
4. Minimize False Convictions
    * Arguably most important value—almost always trumps others
    * *Brady*
    * Requiring proof BRD
    * Extra protections for ∆-witness
    * Double jeopardy
5. Minimize accusation & Litigation burdens
    * Just being accused of a crime may bring reputational harm, expense
    * PC hearings, review of charges by magistrate, etc.
6. Facilitate Lay Participation
    * "the administration of the criminal justice process is too important to be left exclusively in the hands of government officials."
    * "Vesting decisionmaking authority in lay jurors, 'neither legally trained nor routinely engaged in the administration of criminal justice,' arguably strengthens the factfinding capacity of the process. The jurors' 'very inexperience is an asset because it secures a fresh perception of each trial, avoiding the stereotypes said to infect the judicial eye.'"
7. Respect the Dignity of Individuals
8. Appearance of Fairness
