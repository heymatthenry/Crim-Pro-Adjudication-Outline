## Generally

* There is no constitutional right to a criminal appeal
    - But in a circumstance under which a jxn allows one, it can't be contingent on ∆'s ability to pay

## Standards of Review

* The standard for review in a criminal appeal depends on the issue:
    - Findings of fact are reviewed according to the **clear error** standard
    - Mixed questions of fact and law are reviewed based on an **abuse of discretion** standard
        - Unless ∆ did not make a contemporaneous objection, in which case **plain error** review applies, based on the obviousness of the error and the egregiousness of the effect
    - Purely legal issues get **plenary** (de novo, full) review
* *AZ v. Fulminante*: Some errors defy measurement and are *structural*, e.g.: right to counsel, right to be pro se, right to a public trial, exclusion of jurors of ∆'s race, bad instruction re: reasonable doubt
    * Structural errors require an automatic reversal
        * Defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism
        * e.g. Biased judge
    * Trial errors are subject to **harmless error** review 
        * Can be ascertained by reviewing the record
        * e.g. Error applying *Bruton*
* The primary value at stake in criminal appeals is accuracy of outcomes
