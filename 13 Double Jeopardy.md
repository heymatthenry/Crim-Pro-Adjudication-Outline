# Double Jeopardy

> ...nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.

* 5A protects against 
    * second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal
    * second prosecution for the same offense after conviction
    * multiple punishments for the same offense
* *Benton*: state shouldn't get a second go. Otherwise ∆ would have additional:
    - Embarrassment
    - Expense
    - Ordeal
    - Anxiety
* Mistrial is permissible when required by "manifest necessity," e.g. a deadlocked jury
    - Record should show that judge considered alternatives before declaring a mistrial

## Preclusion

### Claim Preclusion (Res Judicata)

* *Blockburger* test for whether two charges consist in the "same offense":
    - Two offenses are different when one has an element that the other does not.
    * **BUT**: If a lesser included offense is charged first, and conduct satisfying the additional element(s) of the greater had not occurred or was not known at the time of the first trial, a new trial on the greater offense is okay
* *MO v. Hunter*: one trial with multiple, cumulative, or consecutive punishments is okay
* Applies whether outcome is conviction or acquittal

### Issue Preclusion (Collateral Estoppel)

* When ∆ is *acquitted*, a second proscution may be barred when one particular element has been conclusively disproved
* *Ash v. Swenson*: test for CE is whether a rational juror could have acquitted ∆ on an issue other than the one ∆ wants to foreclose
* CE applies to issues/elements—not to evidence
    * If ∆ is successful in showing that an element is precluded, the state may still re-introduce the evidence that was used to prove that element in order to prove something else

Doctrine of implied acquittal
:   Conviction on a lesser included offense implies acquittal of the balance of elements in the greater offense
