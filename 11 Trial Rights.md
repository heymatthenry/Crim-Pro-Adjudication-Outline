* [Defense right to cross-examine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYsPbC5DV1Q&list=UUW8X2enjxf9LsaZ_qci90jA "Duties to Disclose and Preserve Evidence - YouTube")

## Defendant’s right to testify (or not…)

* The constitution contains no explicit guarantee of the right to testify
    * This right is implied through the fifth amendment due process guarantee, the sixth amendment compulsory process clause, the sixth amendment right to self-representation, and as a corollary to the fifth amendment ban on self incrimination
* The defendant also has a right not to testify and the court or prosecuting attorneys may not comment on the refusal to testify
    * You cannot suggest that the defendant had the burden to prove a fact beyond a reasonable doubt.  That violates the defendant’s right not to have a proof burden cast upon them
* Under the 5th amendment the criminal accused has a right to refuse to testify.
    * The prosecutor may not call the defendant as a witness in its case in chief
    * The witness is also allowed to decline to testify in his or her own defense
        * If the defendant does decide to testify, they waive the 5th amendment priviliege for cross examination on any issue that is relevant to the case
* The waiver of the 5th amendment does not apply to matter that are relevant only for impeachment
* It violates the defendant right to testify if there is a rule stating that the defendant has to testify first if he wants to testify.
    * The state wanted this rule because they didn’t want the D to tailor his testimony to be consistent with other previously elicited testimony
    * The prosecutor is allowed to comment on the fact that the defendant was able to tailor his testimony based on prior witnesses.
* The defendant has a right to a no adverse inference instruction upon request.

## Compulsory Process

* Comes from the Sixth amendment
    * The right to present the defendant’s version of the facts
* Where a court finds a willful violation of a discovery rule it is not arbitrary or unlawful to impose a sanction of preclusion of that witnesses testimony.
* There is a right to non-interference (by the govt) with witnesses.
    * But they can deport a witness and the D gets no relief unless he can make a persuasive showing that the witnesses would have affected the outcome of the case (pretty much the same standard as Brady).

## Confrontation and Cross Examination

* Accused has the right to confront witnesses against him.  This includes the right to physical face to face confrontation and the right to cross examine
* The supreme court has ruled that courts may use their discretion to limit the scope and time limits of the cross examination
* The defendant has the right to cross examine an informant who is the principle defense witness as to their true name and address
* The defendant can cross examine a witness as to their status as a probationer
