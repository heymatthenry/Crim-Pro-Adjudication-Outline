## Right to Jury Trial

Venire
: the large group drawn together to serve as potential prospective–From that venire, individual petit juries are selected

* Fair Cross Section
    * *Taylor v. Louisiana*—guarantees the defendant a representative fair cross-section of the community.  The 6th amendment says nothing about this but the S.Ct. read this requirement into the constitution
        a.  Challenged a law that presumed men to be eligible to serve on juries but said that women would be eligible only if they filed a written declaration of their desire to serve.
    * The guarantee is for a *venire* representing the community, not a petit jury
* *Duren* test for cross section rights
    1. Group is distinctive
        * Defined and limited by some clearly identifiable attitude
        * Has a common thread or similarity of experience running through it
        * Has a community of interest among the members such that the group’s interest cannot be adequately represented if the group is excluded from the jury selection process
    2. Representation of the group is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community
        * Fair And Reasonable
            * Absolute disparity test (preferred test)(10% seems to be the magic number)
                * Takes the distinctive group representation in the venire and subtracts it from the representation in the larger community
            * Comparative disparity test
                * Takes the absolute disparity figure and divides that by the underrepresented groups share of the overall population
    3. Under-representation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the selection process
        * Systematic does NOT mean intentional
            * This is a big difference from Equal Protection
        * Systematic does mean that it comes from government action (i.e. not a natural disaster) 
    4. No sufficiently important government interest in the exclusion outweighs the defendant’s interest in a fair cross-section

## Jury Size & Unanimity

* Juries must have at least 6 members
* The constitution does not require that jury verdicts be unanimous
    - *unless* the jury only has 6 members

## Jury Selection

### Voir Dire

Voir Dire
:   the questioning of prospective jurors to see if they have any disqualifying bias.

Actual prejudice
:   direct exposure to a degree of publicity that would allow a judge to conclude that a juror could not set aside what he or she thought about the case and make an unbiased decision.

* *Rideau v. Louisiana*—extreme cases of publicity (extra-judicial information not in the record) can mandate a change of venue.
    * Simple fact of jurors awareness of pre-trial publicity does not madate change of venue and if such a jurr were to sit on a jury it would not necessarily be a constitutional violation.
    * Constitution does not mandate in-depth voir dire (*Mu’Min v. VA*); courts have lots of discretion in doing voir dire.  No constitutional obligation to find out what the juror saw or heard about the case.
    * They must only ask the questions the court feels are appropriate to make a finding that the juror can or cannot make an unbiased determination about the case.
* When the case in chief or the defense has something to do with issues of race or ethnicity, there is a constitutional right to voir dire questions that at least probe the issue of whether race and ethnicity will affect the jurors’ ability to fairly reach a verdict
    * *Hamm v. S.C.*—the defense asks that the court to question the jury during voir dire about racial prejudice and the fact that the defendant had a beard.
    * This case took place in the time of the black power movement.  Use of the term black vs. negro is part of the politicization of the terminology and the black power movement.
    * In federal cases, the supreme court held that questions need to be asked about the impact of race in any case that involves cross-racial violence (using their supervisory power)

### Challenges for Cause

* After voir dire, the attorneys are able to challenge the inclusion of individual jurors.  There is no limit on the number of challenges for cause.
* Challenge for cause are grounded in the due process clause; they are grounded in a claim that this juror harbors a bias or stands in a relationship with a party to the case which would make them an unfair arbiter within the meaning of the due process clause.
* Actual Bias—subjective  inquiry; there is lodged in this person’s brain and emotional state a real bias.  The existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not act with complete impartiality.
* Implied Bias—objective inquiry; not an inquiry into the mind of the particular individual.  Instead the question is whether an average person in that juror’s position would be biased.  Presumed when the relationship between the juror and the litigation is such that it is highly unlikely that an average person would remain unbiased.
    * Implied bias is not to be lightly or easily found.  It is to be reserved for the extreme circumstances that leave serious question whether the juror can be fair.
    * It can be shown by a demonstration that the juror is an employee of the prosecuting authority, juror is a close relative of one of the participants in the trial, juror was a witness to some part of the transaction giving rise to the litigation, etc….

### Peremptory Challenges

#### Generally

* The opposite of challenge for cause. Challenge for cause requires a clear articulation of the basis for a finding of actual or implied bias. Peremptory challenges on the other hand do not require such a finding.

#### Batson

* Swain v. Alabama—supreme court held that if a defendant could show that over time in a number of cases, prosecutors were removing African American jurors in cases against African American defendants that would be a prima facie case of equal protection violation.
* Batson rejected the idea that defendants have to prove that this is going on over multiple cases.
* The defendant can prove bias in a single case by satisfying a multi-step test:
    - Prima facie showing:
        * Plaintiff must prove that he or she is a member of a cognizable racial group
            * Suspect and quasi suspect classes from the equal protection clause
        * Show that the prosecutor has exercised preemptories to remove from the jury members of the defendant’s race
        * Show that all of the circumstances raise an inference that race was the basis of the prosecutor’s action.
    - Then the burden shifts to the prosecution to provide a race neutral explanation
    - If the prosecutor clears this hurdle, the defendant can argue that the prosecutor’s stated motive was pre-textual
    - Then the court makes a finding as to whether or not this was racially motivated
* Prima facie case is lower than a preponderance standard
* *Powers v. OH* removes the “of the defendant’s race” language from the second part of the Batson test. Batson challenges can be cross-racial.
