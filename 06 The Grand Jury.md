# The Grand Jury

## Generally

* Laypeople determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime was committed by the accused.
* *Shield and Sword*—as a shield it acts as a buffer between the accused and unfounded accusations. As a sword it functions as an investigative body to gather information and determine whether formal criminal charges should be brought
    1. GJ can serve as an inquisitorial body with no obligation to consider both sides of a case. 
        * Target has no right to appear or present arguments with respect to determination of PC
    2. Because the GJ usually hears the cases presented to it by the Prosecutor, many associate it with the interests of the government. 
        * The accusation is often made that the GJ is not independent and they act as a rubber stamp for prosecutors

## Grand Jury Practice under the Federal Rules

* The Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution provides: 

> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.

* "Infamous crimes" == all felonies
* A **presentment** is a formal charging document issued by the grand jury in cases not initiated by the prosecutions office
* The more common charging instrument is the **indictment**, a form used in cases brought to the grand jury by the prosecutor.

## State Practice

* The GJ is not incorporated to the states by the 14th amendment
* Thus many states do not require an indictment, but rather use an information which is a charging document drafted by the prosecutor.

##  Legal Powers

* May use subpoenas to require a witness to testify or produce physical evidence
* Uncooperative witnesses in the GJ face contempt sanctions by a judge
*  Operates in near total secrecy
    * Avoids embarrassment to accused
    * Prevents leaks of info to protential defendants
    * Reduces chance that witness will be threatened
* Secrecy increases chance that witness will step forward and testify freely without fear of retaliation (U.S. v. ProctorGamble)
* While the witness can invoke the 5th, the GJ can grant immunity and force that person to reveal incriminating information
* Similar to the preliminary hearing, the return of “no true bill” (lack of PC) is not final and thus no double jeopardy. Prosecution can reinitiate case through new GJ or through information and preliminary hearing.

## Procedures

* **Size**
    * Range from 7-23 persons
        * 16-23 in federal system; requires 12 to indict.
* **Foreperson**: Usually appointed by the judge of the empaneling court; sometimes chosen by other jurors.
* Term can last from 10 days to 18 mo. In state courts; federal GJ can sit up to 18 mo. And can be extended by an additional 6 mo
* Requires an oath of office from each juror
* No judge at GJ, usually controlled by the prosecutor
    * Subject of investigation has no right to appear, and when the suspect does appear he or she is not entitled to counsel
* The judge has the power to convene or dismiss the GJ (unless dismissal is provided by statute only), and has the power to deny request to issue a subpoena, and may quash for cause any indictments returned, and divulge record of GJ proceedings on a showing of “particularized need”
* Because of the non-adversarial nature of the proceedings, the rules of evidence are relaxed, though privileges apply with full force.
    * See e.g *U.S. v. Costello*—allowing the use of hearsay evidence in a GJ proceeding


## Challenging an indictment**

* A defense attorney may bring a challenge to an indictment prior to trial. This is usually done through a Motion to Dismiss under Fed. R. Crim. Pro. 12(b) or a comparable state rule.

### Grounds

#### Statutory

* Defective proceedings
* Defective indictment
* Insufficient evidence
    * Knowingly presenting perjured testimony
        * Perjured testimony must be “material” in order to overturn the indictment
    * Indictment based on no evidentiary requirements whatsoever

#### Other    

* Selection of GJ members
* Bias by GJ members
    * Fifth amendment contains no impartiality guarantee (different than petit jury requirement under 6A)
    * In dicta the court has mused that the state must furnish unbiased GJ under 14A
* GJ misfeasance
* Unauthorized presence
* Prosecutorial misconduct
    * Inflaming the GJ—comments designed to improperly influence the GJ
        * Rarely results in dismissal b/c of lack of prejudice to the accused
    * Stating personal views
    * Testifying before the GJ
    * Rendering improper or inadequate legal advice
        * If the prosecutor is asked whether certain conduct amounts to a criminal offense and his response is somehow incorrect or inadequate this is objectionable

## Cases

* *United States v. Williams*
    * The government is not required to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. When a defendant seeks to overturn an indictment, he must bear the burden of proving his own argument.
* *Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States*
    * The court cannot dismiss an indictment for errors in GJ proceedings unless such errors prejudice the defendant
        * Court cannot invoke supervisory powers to circumvent the harmless error standard
* *US v. Mechanik* 
    * prejudice standard: 
        * Dismiss indictment only if: *it is established that the violation substantially influenced the gj decision to indict, or if there is “grave doubt” that the decision to indict was free from substantial influence of such violations*
        * cases may also be dismissed without a finding of prejudice to the defendant if the error is deemed fundamental.
        * These are the cases in which the structural protections of the GJ have been so compromised as to render the proceedings fundamentally unfair, allowing the presumption of prejudice
        * equal protection discrimination in selection of grand jury foreman is the exception and a claim you can win on. (*Vasquez v. Hillery*)
