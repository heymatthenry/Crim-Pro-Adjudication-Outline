# Plea Bargaining

## Generally

*  This is a form of plea negotiation in which the prosecutor makes certain concessions in exchange for the defendant’s guilty or nolo contendere plea

### Policy/Values Considerations

* Administrative need/necessity
    * It is argued that many criminal defendants will have little incentive to plead guilty without the bargaining process, and thus will insist on trial
    * We have inadequate resources to conduct a full trial in every criminal case
* Fair and accurate results?
    * Some commentators assert that the plea bargaining process will result in innocent people pleading guilty
* Disparity
    * Evidence suggests that disparities in sentencing result from differential plea bargaining rather than from real distinctions between offenders or offenses.
* The supreme court has held that the constitution does not bar sentencing defendant who plead guilty to a lesser sentence than those who go to trial
* Invisibility
    * Some argue that judges should not be allowed to deny the public the educative and deterrent role that attaches to a contested and visible public trial
* Effect upon counsel
    * Routine plea bargaining may lead to lackadaisical preparation by defense counsel
    * This would violate the D’s right to counsel under the 6A
* Overcharging
    * Horizontal—multiple offenses
    * Vertical—charge offense at maximum and then bargain for lesser included offense
    * The existence of probable cause and a good faith assessment of “tryability” are what set the outer limits on the number and severity of charges a prosecutor may responsibly bring

## Types of Agreements

Charge Agreements
:   One in which the government agree that the defendant will plead guilty to one or more specific charges in exchange for the government’s assent to dismiss other pending charges

Recommendation Agreements
:   In this agreement the defendant agrees to plead guilty and in exchange the prosecuting authority agrees to make certain recommendations regarding sentencing or not to resist of oppose a sentencing recommendation made by the defense

Specific Sentence Agreements
:   Specific sentence guarantees entail a guilty plea in exchange for an agreement from the government that the court will impose a specific sentence or use (or not use) a certain sentencing formula, factor, or guideline
    * The court has the authority to reject such a deal and the defendant can then withdraw the guilty plea

Fact Stipulation Agreements
:   A separate agreement in which pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the offense are agreed upon
    * This agreement is contemplated by the federal sentencing guidelines and is meant to explicate certain facts that the federal judge relies on to support the particular sentence within statutory ranges

### Variations

Conditional Pleas
:   Designed to make it possible for the defendant to enter a guilty plea yet preserve the pretrial motion for appellate review
:   A defendant who prevails on appeal may then withdraw the plea (Fed. R. Crim. Pro. 11(a)(2)).

Agreements for Cooperation
:   This form of agreement contemplates a favorable disposition for the accused in exchange for cooperation with the government, usually in the form of testimony against other defendants
:   Cooperation agreements entail a precise description of the cooperation to be provided as well as a clear delineation of the scope of the immunity or nature of the plea bargain benefit extended by the government
:   Disfavored by the courts when the agreement requires ∆ to testify to certain stipulated facts, but not disfavored when they require ∆ to testify truthfully and completely

## Breach of Plea Agreements

### Generally

* Because of the contractual nature of plea agreements, cases arise in which one party claims that the other party breached the agreement.
* Plea agreements should be in writing and they should be written precisely.  A well written agreement helps the court and reviewing courts determine the nature of the promises made.  When ambiguities arise, the courts apply contract law to interpret the agreement, but because the defendant’s liberty is at stake ambiguities will be resolved against the state.  In other words the courts hold prosecutors to a higher standard.

### Breach By Prosecutor

* plea bargaining is an important step in the criminal process and ought not be dismissed. Because he felt it was the realm of the trial court to determine sentencing, the case was remanded to the trial judge to make a determination of either re-sentencing, as per the plea agreement or whether the defendant would be allowed to withdraw his plea.

### Breach By Defendant

* The Court held that defendant's breach of the plea agreement between the parties removed the double jeopardy bar to prosecution of defendant on the first-degree murder charges that he faced prior to the plea agreement.  
* The Court held that the double jeopardy clause did not relieve defendant of the consequences of his voluntary choice to challenge the plea agreement.  
* Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, after defendant's challenge failed, the consequences were that defendant was returned the position he occupied prior to execution of the agreement.
