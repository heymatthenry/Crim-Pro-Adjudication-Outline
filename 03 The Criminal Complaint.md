# The Criminal Complaint

> **Rule 3 of Fed. R. Crim. Pro** \
> The complaint is a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. Except as provided in Rule 4.1, it must be made under oath before a magistrate judge or, if none is reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer.

## Purpose

* The complaint serves two roles: 
    1. It begins the formal criminal process by charging the defendant with a crime
        * Notifies the accused of the charges and facilitates the preliminary hearing
    2. It provides the basis for the arrest warrant
        * Has been described as the principal function of the complaint
        * If the complaint provides for adequate probable cause, the judge may sign an arrest warrant at the same time he signs a complaint; this practice is embraced by Rule 4 of the Fed. Rules of Criminal Procedure
* Generally the complaint will be the only charging instrument in the life of a misdemeanor case, while a felony complaint will likely be replaced by an indictment from a grand jury or by a prosecutors information.
